# 3D Renderer

## Overview

This is a simple 3D renderer written in Rust. It's designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use.

### Prerequisites for buildig from source

- Rust `1.73.0` (has been tested on 1.73.0 but might work on any version of Rust)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```sh
    git clone https://github.com/RamenG0D/C3DR.git
```

2. Build the project
```sh
    cargo build --release
```
`OR` Run the project
```sh
    cargo run --release
```
